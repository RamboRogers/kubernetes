# Kubernetes Deployments/Manifests
A bunch of Kubernetes formulas I made for myself that I wanted to share.

To deploy it should be simple to use these via,

```
kubectl apply -f filename.yaml
```

I expose these via [metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/). Some will have services, this is from my lab and they all are working as of import.
